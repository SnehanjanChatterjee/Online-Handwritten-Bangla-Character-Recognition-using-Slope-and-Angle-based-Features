### Abstract 
In this paper, two feature extraction procedures namely, slope-angle based feature (SAF) and CG-based slope-angle based features (CGSAF) have been experimented for the recognition of online handwritten Bangla basic characters. First technique computes the slopes and angles made by x-axis with the lines obtained by joining consecutive pixel points. In the second approach, firstly the sample character is divided into k segments. Then the slopes and angles made by the lines drawn through joining the first nodal point of each of the segments with CG (Centre of Gravity), are computed and treated as features for the current experiment. The primary aim of this work is to design efficient features that can accurately describe the different shapes of Bangla alphabet. The current experiment has been performed on 10000 online handwritten Bangla characters and SVM (Support Vector Machine) produces satisfactory recognition accuracy of 99.02% when features produced by SAF and CGSAF are combined with CG.
